# Tip Calculator
Tip Calculator written in Kotlin for Android.

Lets be honest, calculating a tip is a simple idea and you don't need a million features. The app follows that philsophy and is native, does not have any ads or collect any information. The idea is that with all the phone types out there, you should get the most out of it. If you have a small phone, you should have all the features, but have an option to view more. If you have a foldable, you should get more information on both screens and not just stretched.

This is currently ðŸ§°**in development**ðŸ§°.
